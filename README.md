# key-server-admin
CLI Admin Interface for Key Server

## Usage
Key Server Admin comes packaged with all the needed libraries that are needed in addition to the built-in libraries.
To run the Key Server Admin, enter `python Main.py` from inside the directory where the file is located.

On the first run, you will be prompted to enter the key server url. For SDSU, the key server url is `https://its-key-server.herokuapp.com`.


If you have never used the Key Server Admin, type `help` once you have logged in.
